# test-mui

This is a test Project to experiment with React/MUI Data Table and Server-Side filtering, sorting and pagination

We want to have an easy to use table with all the functions like sorting, filtering and pagination handled by the server.

It's a common problem when dealing with large data sets.

Having a good client side experience is easily achievable by using React because there is a React library for everything.

I wouldn't implement my own Table unless I have a really specific use case.

Our first choice for library was MUI X Data Grid but turns out that to use multi filtering, you have to pay MONEY so we had to find another library.

That was Material React Table V2, solid library, with great examples and documentation, very customizable!
